# Really out-of-date map-editor

### Usage

Open index.html in your favorite browser, and click the right-hand-side of the window to init it (bug...)

In your developer console, write `parser.gridToText(drawer.manager.grid)` to actually parse your map.

Oh! And it always writes the map in a square, and to change its size, check out this file: https://github.com/sandsmark/kart/blob/master/map-editor/js/drawer.js#L2

Someone! Please fix it! For the lov of @martin!

### Please feel free to do upgrades!
