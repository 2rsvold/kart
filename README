The Kartering (working title)
=============================

tldr; connect to the server at localhost over port 31337. You receive game
state in JSON, send back a single byte to control it.

This part of the protocol is going to be simplified a bit (switch to sending
specific bytes instead of bitmaps):
The byte is used as a bitmap, so set a bit to do that action (press the key in
parenthesis in a local game):
Bit 0: Accelerate (arrow up key)
Bit 1: Decelerate (arrow down key)
Bit 2: Turn left (arrow left key)
Bit 3: Turn right (arrow right key)
Bit 4: Handbrake/drift (space)
Bit 5: Use powerup (enter)

Some pseudo C code to use it:
    #define NET_INPUT_UP 1<<0
    #define NET_INPUT_DOWN 1<<1
    #define NET_INPUT_LEFT 1<<2
    #define NET_INPUT_RIGHT 1<<3
    #define NET_INPUT_SPACE 1<<4
    #define NET_INPUT_RETURN 1<<5

    char action = NET_INPUT_UP;
    if (want_to_turn_left) {
        action |= NET_INPUT_LEFT;
    }
    send_byte(action);
